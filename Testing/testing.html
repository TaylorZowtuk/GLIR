        <p>Below are recordings of the expected output of the various tests and examples included in the GLIR library. Refer to these videos to check if GLIR is working correctly with the board/Freedom Studio and serial monitor that you choose to use. You can fullscreen the embedded videos or find the sources in Resources/ . You can import all of the tests and examples from their folders in Testing/ into the src/ of your Freedom Studio project. Individually uncomment the .global main directive and main: label and run your project to execute one of the tests.</p>

            <p>A test for the GLIR_PrintLine, GLIR_PrintRect, and GLIR_PrintTriangle
               primitives. Checks printing of both minimal and larger size shape prints.
               Checks out of bounds printing. Checks stacking of shapes. Checks that the
               order that points are specififed for GLIR_PrintLine is irrelevant to the
               end drawing. Checks that providing a string to use for printing primitives
               works as intended.<br><br>

               Note that many shapes look much better when drawn larger. Small shapes will
               suffer from the restrictions of printing to a terminal (terminals and fonts
               are not square even if they are monospace, thus a square grid renders a
               rectangular shape) and the alignment of how characters are printed may look
               off.</p>

            <p>A test for the GLIR_RestoreSettings and GLIR_ClearScreen functionalities of
               the library. Alternates printing a line of unicode block characters and a
               line of text. The unicode characters are printed with different foreground
               colors and the text is printed on black background with different foreground
               colors. After a delay resets the terminal's color settings using
               GLIR_RestoreSettings and clears the screen using GLIR_ClearScreen. With the
               restored color settings, prints one final line of text which should be in
               the color of the default terminal settings.</p>

               background and foreground colors. The next two characters are printed with
               print code 1 and should be printed with terminal default background and

            <p>A demo meant to show off a subroutine created for GLIR called GLIR_ColorDemo.
               This demo attempts to print the 16-256 color gamut of the terminal. It prints
               40 rows of 6 unicode full block char starting at color 16 and incrementing
               the color after each print. This demo's source code illustrates how easy it is
               to create beautiful displays on the terminal using GLIR's subroutines.</p>

            <p>A demo meant to show off GLIR's basic functions (GLIR_BatchPrint,
               GLIR_PrintString, and GLIR_PrintCircle). First, iterates through printable
               characters and colors while performing a batch print between each iteration.
               Next, uses GLIR_PrintString to carve out a message (HI!). Lastly, performs a
               series of calls to GLIR_PrintCircle. The circle is meant to appear to spread
               towards the edges of the terminal eventually going off screen. Looking at this
               demo's source code can give one a good idea of how GLIR is meant to be
               started/stopped as well as how one can use the various methods of printing
               jobs.</p>
